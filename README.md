# freeCodeCamp | Calorie Counter Project

In this calorie counter project, I learnt how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update my interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I learnt basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.

I completed the project on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and pasted the code in VS Code to push into Github.
